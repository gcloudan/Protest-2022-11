This is the biggest wave of protests since the Tank Man in 1989, people of China Mainland finally start to wake up. 

The protests are spreading from universities to several major cities. The major wave of the protests started with a tragedy happened in Ürümqi, the capital city of the Xinjiang province. That city has been under super strict zero-COVID policy lockdown for over 100 days. That means all the citizens has been locked in their home. A few days ago, an apartment building caught fire but people weren't able to escape due to all the exits were locked. So about 10 including children were burnt to death. The CCP of course denied everything, and people decided they have had enough of this dog shit.

Lots of the protesters in those videos were not covering their faces, because they already know the CCP can and will track them done through cell phones, CCTVs and all kinds of surveillance networks. Some of them are holding blank papers without any words on it, that means whatever they want to say, CCP won't allow it, but also people know what they want to say. The words used in these videos and photos are about stopping the zero-COVID policy, the Xi Jinping dictatorship and the CCP; and asking for freedom, basic human rights and justice.

"Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men? It is the music of the people who will not be slaves again!"
